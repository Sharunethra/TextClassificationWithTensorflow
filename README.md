# Text Classification With Tensorflow


This is my capstone project for AI domain. It uses LSTM model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Tools Used:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Python
- Google Colab
- Kaggle IMDB Dataset

## Project Steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Tokenization and padding
3. LSTM model building
4. Training and validation
5. Evaluation and prediction

## Output:
Achieved over 85% accuracy on test data.
